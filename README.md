# Schemish
An experimental language loosely based on Scheme for learning and experiments.

## WARNING
I am just using this for toying around and learning, it is not a good example of how to write parsers, lexers, or generators at this point in time. Maybe one day, but right now I just wanted to monkey around with Scheme-like langs, using TypeScript's type system, and experiment with various techniques and targets.
